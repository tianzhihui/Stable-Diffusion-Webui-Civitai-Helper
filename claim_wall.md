# What you should do
Above are just a very small piece of this kind of claims. Those claims won't help you. If you have an issue, following is the guidline:   

* If you want to make your extension work, read the document.   

* If your SD webui is broken, before you claim it is caused by this extension, you can disable it and try again.   

* If you followed document, but it still doesn't work well, you can check console log's msg to find out the reason. If you can not understand those msg, you can come and ask for help, with console log's msg or screenshot.    

* If you are using colab, and get an error from colab, then search that error msg in google. Because it's a colab's issue or limitation.    

* If you checked console log window's msg and understand what it means, you are welcome to submit your issue.
